# Sui SDKs (Unofficial)

English | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

A multi-language SDK monorepo for the **Sui ecosystem**, focused on practical implementations and developer workflows across different programming languages.

## Project Positioning

- Unofficial implementations: This repository is community/personal maintained and is **not an official SDK release channel of Mysten Labs or the Sui Foundation**.
- Multi-language coverage: Maintain SDKs across languages to support cross-language comparison, migration, and feature parity.
- Engineering-first approach: Emphasize usability, testing, and documentation for real-world integration.

## Repository Structure

- `ts-sdks/`: TypeScript SDK (currently keeps its own Git history)
- `go-sdks/`: Go SDK
- `py-sdks/`: Python SDK
- `java-sdks/`: Java SDK
- `kotlin-sdks/`: Kotlin SDK
- `rust-sdks/`: Rust SDK
- `swift-sdks/`: Swift SDK
- `dart-sdks/`: Dart SDK

## Documentation Site

- Top-level docs site: `docs/`
- Run locally: `cd docs && npm install && npm run dev`

## Getting Started

Go to the target language directory and read its `README.md` for install, build, and test instructions.

## Disclaimer

This is an unofficial project for learning, research, and engineering practice.
Before production usage, run your own security audit, compatibility validation, and risk assessment.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome to improve feature parity, documentation quality, and test coverage across language SDKs.
